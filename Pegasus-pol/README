The files with the functions and subroutines of are located in 
./Routines/, wie the exception of the usr-files.  These are in 
this QCD-Pegasus base directory, together with the main routines.

Go into the folder Routines and type bash G77-obj. This will 
compile the core of the code and place the objects in the folder Objects1. 
The corresponding files for the Intel compiler are generated and moved to
 ./Objects2 by running  IFC-obj.

Then go into the main folder and type bash G77-pol (IFC-pol). 
This will compile the driver code and link it with the core objects to create the executable polevol.x. 
The input parameters of the code are in usrpinit.f. 
The meaning of the parameters should be self-evident.
