Go into the folder `Routines` and type `bash G77-obj`. This will compile the core of the code and place the objects in the folder `Objects1`.  Then go into the main folder and type `bash G77-pol`. This will compile the driver code and link it with the core objects to create the executable `polevol.x`.  The input parameters of the code are in `usrpinit.dat`. The meaning of the parameters should be self-evident.
